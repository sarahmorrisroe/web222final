            <h3>Question: Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h3>
            Responsive design is a concept in the design of web pages that promotes easy readability for all users. This concept allows for web pages that are designed to display well on all types of screens, ranging from large monitors, laptop screens, to small mobile screens. In essence, the concept of responsive design is to provide great user experience without the need to side scrolling and relying solely on up and down scrolling. In a user were to view a webpage on a phone, the amount of content on the page will not change but adapt and make the webpage slightly longer rather than wider depending on the viewing resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Question: How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>
            Responsive design relates to web technologies because it is important for web developers and designers to be attentive about the users that are going to be viewing their web pages. This concept is important to take into consideration when designing pages because the CSS design will impact how the webpage is displayed. For example, some of the most important ways that can make a webpage have a better viewing experience on any device is to use percentages in page elements rather than units that are absolute. This will allow for the page to scale with the viewing display. Another thing that can make the page more adaptive is having images scales in relative units rather than using an absolute unit such as 100px.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Question: What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>
            Through my research of learning about the concept of responsive web design, I learned to be more conscientious about how I design web pages. The main goal of my website’s design is to allow for optimal viewing experience for the user, no matter what device or window screen size they are viewing it from. I used sizing on my website in relative units such as a percentage rather than absolute units such as pt or px in my CSS design. For example, my main webpage’s body is set to 80% rather than an absolute unit such as 1000px, even though the instructions for the assignment assume the desktop screen width is fixed at 1100px. This is to accommodate for the wide range of possible viewing methods. I was able to test this by adjusting my browser size.

            <h3>Question: describe your learning experience in the course</h3>
            In this course, I had a good experience learning about the fundamentals of web. In this course, I found that the structure of marking was very fair and also was relevant to assist in my education. I enjoyed the weekly lectures on the topics and found them to be very in depth with a good number of examples. If I did not understand the course information, the professor was very helpful with taking student questions and providing solutions. The weekly tests were useful in testing the information that were taught in the weekly lectures. The assignments were also assigned with a fair amount of time to tackle the problems with the concepts taught in the previous weeks’ lectures. I found that having multiple assignments rather than large tests such as a midterm or final helped solidify my understanding of web programming better because it was more applicable and forced me to approach the problems with a problem-solving approach rather than remembering information.
